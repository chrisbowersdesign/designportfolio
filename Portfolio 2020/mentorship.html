                <p class="t-body">When we first sat down with CollegeVine’s founders, the mentorship program was in full swing with hundreds of students enrolled. The program was spread across trello, google docs, spreadsheets, and CollegeVine software, making it challenging for mentors to manage.</p>
                <p class="t-body">The heart and soul of this service is regular video calls between mentors and mentees. We set out to design a dedicated web app that would improve the service behind these successful calls. </p>

                <p class="t-body">From the existing curriculum, we identified that the year plan needed to be revised. Mentors would map out a student’s entire year by month after only a couple of meetings. This level of granularity led to generic plans that made parents question the program.</p>

            <p class="t-body">High school students have busy schedules, and they need to juggle several different goals and assignments at a time. During this phase, we reviewed different groupings for the to-do list with students and mentors. They preferred to focus on the current week with some future or ongoing tasks shown in case they get ahead or need reminding. </p>

            <p class="t-body-italics job-story">When a week ends, mentors want to reference the year plan so they can update the to-do list.</p>
            <p class="t-body">Instead of listing goals across multiple weeks, we grouped them by category. This way mentors can add to a manageable list as they get to know their mentees. </p>
            <p class="t-body">Some goals have a predictable list of tasks to complete. Referencing project management tools, we linked the year plan to the to-do list. Now a mentor could create an action plan that can be added to the to-do list when it’s ready to be worked on. </p>

            <p class="t-body">The program created monthly reports to involve parents in the mentorship process, but they were too granular and used graphs that didn’t tell a meaningful story. We prioritized update messages from the mentor and manager, and added a commenting feature for individual goals.</p>

            <p class="t-body">I wish I had access to CollegeVine’s Mentor program when I was in high school. With this in mind, I was careful not to rely on my personal biases during this project. From our research and exploration, we identified additional features that were out of scope. Some of them being a calendar view for the year plan, and a card view for the to-do list. Due to the nature of this project, we were not able to see it through to implementation and usability testing.</p>
